# :wave: How can I contribute?

First off, thank you for helping to improve this chart! :heart_eyes: :pray:

## Testing

To test the chart locally, before submitting changes, run `./ci/scripts/local-ci.sh`

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/funkypenguin/helm-docker-mailserver/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

When you send a pull request, please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit), and bump the chart version in `chart.yaml`

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks again!
